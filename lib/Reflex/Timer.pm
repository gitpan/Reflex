=head1 NAME

Reflex::Timer - An object that watches the passage of time.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.055

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# Several examples in the eg directory use Reflex::Timer.

	use warnings;
	use strict;

	use lib qw(../lib);

	use Reflex::Timer;

	my $t = Reflex::Timer->new(
		interval    => 1,
		auto_repeat => 1,
	);

	while (my $event = $t->next()) {
		print "next() returned an event (@$event)\n";
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reflex::Timer emits events to mark the passage of time.  Its interface
is new and small.  Please contact the Reflex project if you need other
features, or send us a pull request at github or gitorious.

=head1 PUBLIC ATTRIBUTES

=head2 interval

Define the interval between creation and the "tick" event's firing.
If auto_repeat is also set, this becomes the interval between
recurring "tick" events.

=head2 auto_repeat

A Boolean value.  When true, Reflex::Timer will repeatedly fire "tick"
events every interval seconds.

=head1 PUBLIC EVENTS

=head2 tick

Reflex::Timer emits "tick" events.  We're looking for a better name,
so this may change in the future.  Your suggestions can help solidify
the interface quicker.
