=head1 NAME

Reflex::Role::PidCatcher - add async process reaping behavior to a class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Reflex::PID;

  use Moose;
  extends 'Reflex::Base';

  has pid => (
    is        => 'ro',
    isa       => 'Int',
    required  => 1,
  );

  has active => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'Bool',
    default => 1,
  );

  with 'Reflex::Role::PidCatcher' => {
    pid						=> 'pid',
    active        => 'active',
    cb_exit       => 'on_exit',
    method_start  => 'start',
    method_stop   => 'stop',
    method_pause  => 'pause',
    method_resume => 'resume',
  };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reflex::Role::PidCatcher is a Moose parameterized role that adds
asynchronous child process reaping behavior to Reflex based classes.
The SYNOPSIS is the entire implementation of Reflex::PID, a simple
class that allows Reflex::Role::PidCatcher to be used as an object.

=head2 Required Role Parameters

None.  All role parameters as of this writing have what we hope are
sensible defaults.  Please let us know if they don't seem all that
sensible.

=head2 Optional Role Parameters

=head3 pid

C<pid> sets the name of an attribute that will contain the process ID
to wait for.  Process IDs must be integers.

=head3 active

C<active> specifies whether Reflex::Role::PidCatcher should be created
in the active, process-watching state.  All Reflex watchers are
enabled by default.  Set it to a false value, preferably 0, to
initialize the catcher in an inactive or paused mode.

Process watchers may currently be paused and resumed, but this
functionality may be dropped later.  It's not good to leave child
processes hanging.  See C<method_pause> and C<method_resume> for ways
to override the default method names.

=head3 cb_exit

C<cb_exit> names the $self method that will be called when the child
process identified in C<<$self->$pid()>> exits.  It defaults to
"on_%s_exit", where %s is the name of the PID attribute.  For example,
it will be "on_transcoder_exit" if the process ID is stored in a
"transcoder" attribute.

=head3 method_start

C<method_start> sets the name of the method that may be used to start
watching for a process exit.  It's "start_%s" by default, where %s is
the name of the process ID's attribute.

Reflex::Role::PidCatcher will automatically start watching for its
process ID if the value of C<active>'s attribute is true.

=head3 method_stop

C<method_stop> may be used to permanently stop a process ID watcher.
Stopped watchers cannot be restarted, so use C<method_pause> if you
need to temporarily disable them instead.  C<method_resume> may be
used to resume them again.

Process ID catchers will automatically stop watching for process exit
upon DEMOLISH.

=head3 method_pause

C<method_pause> sets the name of the method that may be used to pause
process catching.  It is "pause_%s" by default, where %s is the name
of the PID attribute.

=head3 method_resume

C<method_resume> sets the name of the method that may be used to
resume process reaping.  It is "resume_%s" by default, where %s is the
name of the attribute holding the process ID.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Reflex::Role::PidCatcher was initially written to support Reflex::PID,
so there aren't many examples of the role's use by itself.

L<Reflex::POE::Wheel::Run> actualy uses Reflex::PID.

eg/eg-07-wheel-run.pl uses Reflex::POE::Wheel::Run.
