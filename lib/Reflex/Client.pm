=head1 NAME

Reflex::Client - A non-blocking socket client.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.060

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is a complete working TCP echo client.  It's the version of
eg/eg-35-tcp-client.pl available at the time of this writing.

	use lib qw(../lib);

	{
		package TcpEchoClient;
		use Moose;
		extends 'Reflex::Client';

		sub on_client_connected {
			my ($self, $args) = @_;
			$self->connection()->put("Hello, world!\n");
		};

		sub on_client_data {
			my ($self, $args) = @_;

			# Not chomped.
			warn "got from server: $args->{data}";

			# Disconnect after we receive the echo.
			$self->stop();
		}
	}

	TcpEchoClient->new(
		remote_addr => '127.0.0.1',
		remote_port => 12345,
	)->run_all();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reflex::Client is scheduled for substantial changes.  One of its base
classes, Reflex::Handle, will be deprecated in favor of
Reflex::Role::Readable and Reflex::Role::Writable.  Hopefully
Reflex::Client's interfaces won't change much as a result, but
there are no guarantees.
Your ideas and feedback for Reflex::Client's future implementation
are welcome.

Reflex::Client is a high-level base class for non-blocking socket
clients.  As with other Reflex::Base classes, this one may be
subclassed, composed with "has", or driven inline with promises.

=head2 Attributes

Reflex::Client extends (and includes the attributes of)
Reflex::Connector, which extends Reflex::Handle.  It also provides its
own attributes.

=head3 protocol

The "protocol" attribute contains the name of a class that will handle
I/O for the client.  It contains "Reflex::Stream" by default.

Protocol classes should extend Reflex::Stream or at least follow its
interface.

=head2 Public Methods

Reflex::Client extends Reflex::Handle, but it currently provides no
additional methods.

=head2 Events

Reflex::Client emits some of its own high-level events based on its
components' activities.

=head3 connected

Reflex::Client emits "connected" to notify consumers when the client
has connected, and it's safe to begin sending data.

=head3 data

Reflex::Client emits stream data with the "data" event.  This event is
provided by Reflex::Stream.  Please see L<Reflex::Stream/data> for the
most current documentation.

=head1 EXAMPLES

eg/eg-35-tcp-client.pl subclasses Reflex::Client as TcpEchoClient.
