=head1 NAME

Reflex::Trait::Observed - Automatically watch Reflex objects.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.080

=head1 SYNOPSIS

# Not a complete program.  This example comes from Reflex's main
# L<synopsis|Reflex/SYNOPSIS>.

	has clock => (
		isa     => 'Reflex::Interval',
		is      => 'rw',
		traits  => [ 'Reflex::Trait::Observed' ],
		setup   => { interval => 1, auto_repeat => 1 },
	);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reflex::Trait::Observed modifies a member to automatically observe any
Reflex::Base object stored within it.  In the SYNOPSIS, storing a
Reflex::Interval in the clock() attribute allows the owner to watch the
timer's events.

This trait is a bit of Moose-based syntactic sugar for Reflex::Base's
more explict watch() and watch_role() methods.

=head2 setup

The "setup" option provides default constructor parameters for the
attribute.  In the above example, clock() will by default contain

	Reflex::Interval->new(interval => 1, auto_repeat => 1);

In other words, it will emit the Reflex::Interval event ("tick") once
per second until destroyed.

=head2 role

Attribute events are mapped to the owner's methods using Reflex's
role-based callback convention.  For example, Reflex will look for an
on_clock_tick() method to handle "tick" events from an object with the
'clock" role.

The "role" option allows roles to be set or overridden.  A watcher
attribute's name is its default role.

=head1 Declarative Syntax

Reflex::Trait::Observed exports a declarative observes() function,
which acts almost identically to Moose's has() but with a couple
convenient defaults: The Observed trait is added, and the attribute is
given "rw" access by default.

=head1 CAVEATS

The "setup" option is a work-around for unfortunate default timing.
It will be deprecated if default can be made to work instead.
