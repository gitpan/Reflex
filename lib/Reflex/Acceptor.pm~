Reflex::Acceptor - non-blocking client socket acceptor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	package TcpEchoServer;

	use Moose;
	extends 'Reflex::Acceptor';
	use Reflex::Collection;
	use EchoStream;  # See eg directory.

	has clients => (
		is      => 'rw',
		isa     => 'Reflex::Collection',
		default => sub { Reflex::Collection->new() },
		handles => { remember_client => "remember" },
	);

	sub on_accept {
		my ($self, $args) = @_;
		$self->remember_client(
			EchoStream->new(
				handle => $args->{socket},
				rd     => 1,
			)
		);
	}

	sub on_error {
		my ($self, $args) = @_;
		warn "$args->{errfun} error $args->{errnum}: $args->{errstr}\n";
		$self->stop();
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reflex::Acceptor takes a listening socket and produces new sockets for
clients that connect to it.  It is almost entirely implemented in
Reflex::Role::Accepting.  That role's documentation contains important
details that won't be covered here.

=head2 Public Attributes

=head3 listener

Reflex::Acceptor defines a single attribute, C<listner>, which should
be set to a listening socket of some kind.  Reflex::Acceptor requires
an externally supplied socket so that the user may specify any and all
applicable socket options.

If necessary, the class may later supply a basic socket by default.

Reflex::Role::Accepting explains C<listener> in more detail.

=head2 Public Methods

=head3 pause

pause() will temporarily stop the server from accepting more clients.
See C<method_pause> in Reflex::Role::Accepting for details.

=head3 resume

resume() will resume a temporarily stopped server so that it may
accept more client connections.  See C<method_resume> in
Reflex::Role::Accepting for details.

=head3 stop

stop() will permanently stop the server from accepting more clients.
See C<method_stop> in Reflex::Role::Accepting for details.

=head2 Callbacks

=head3 on_accept

C<on_accept> is called whenever Perl's built-in accept() function
returns a socket.  Reflex::Role::Accepting explains the data returned
with C<on_accept>.  If necessary, that role will also define a default
C<on_accept> handler that emits an "accept" event.

=head3 on_error

C<on_error> is called whenever Perl's built-in accept() function
returns an error.  Reflex::Role::Accepting explains the data returned
with C<on_error>.  If necessary, that role will also define a default
C<on_error> handler that emits an "error" event.

=head2 Public Events

Reflex::Acceptor emits events related to accepting client connections.
These events are defined by Reflex::Role::Accepting, and they will be
explained there.

=head3 accept

If no C<on_accept> handler is set, then Reflex::Acceptor will emit an
"accept" event for every client connection accepted.
Reflex::Role::Accepting explains this event in more detail.

=head3 error

If no C<on_error> handler is set, then Reflex::Acceptor will emit an
"error" event every time accept() returns an error.
Reflex::Role::Accepting explains this event in more detail.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The SYNOPSIS is an excerpt from eg/eg-34-tcp-server-echo.pl.
