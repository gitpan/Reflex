=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reflex::Base is a base class for all reactive Reflex objects,
including many of the ones that notify programs of external events.

Please see L<Reflex::Role::Reactive>, which contains the
implementation and detailed documentation for this class.  The
documentation is kept with the role in order for them to be near each
other.  It's so romantic!
