version 0.080

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# See eg-18-synopsis-no-moose.pl if you don't like Moose.
	# See eg-32-promise-tiny.pl if you prefer promises (condvar-like).
	# See eg-36-coderefs-tiny.pl if you prefer coderefs and/or closures.

		package App;
		use Moose;
		extends 'Reflex::Base';

		observes ticker => (
			isa     => 'Reflex::Interval',
			setup   => { interval => 1, auto_repeat => 1 },

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reflex is a library of classes that assist with writing reactive (AKA
event-driven) programs.  Reflex uses Moose internally, but it doesn't
enforce programs to use Moose's syntax.  However, Moose syntax brings
several useful features we hope will become indispensible.

Reflex is considered "reactive" because it's an implementation of the
reactor pattern.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern

=head2 About Reactive Objects

Reactive objects provide responses to interesting (to them) stimuli.
For example, an object might be waiting for input from a client, a
signal from an administrator, a particular time of day, and so on.
The App object in the SYNOPSIS is waiting for timer ticks.  It
generates console messages in response to those timer ticks.

=head2 Example Reactive Objects

Here an Echoer class emits "pong" events in response to ping()
commands.  It uses Moose's extends(), but it could about as easily use
warnings, strict, and base instead.  Reflex::Base provides emit().

	package Echoer;
	use Moose;
	extends 'Reflex::Base';

	sub ping {
		my ($self, $args) = @_;
		print "Echoer was pinged!\n";
		$self->emit( event => "pong" );
	}

The next object uses Echoer.  It creates an Echoer and pings it to get
started.  It also reacts to "pong" events by pinging the Echoer again.
Reflex::Trait::Observed (via its exported observes() declarative
syntax) implicitly watches the object in echoer(), mapping its "pong"
event to the on_echoer_pong() method.

	package Pinger;
	use Moose;
	extends 'Reflex::Base';

	observes echoer => (
		isa     => 'Echoer',
		default => sub { Echoer->new() },
	);

	sub BUILD {
		my $self = shift;
		$self->echoer->ping();
	}

	sub on_echoer_pong {
		my $self = shift;
		print "Pinger got echoer's pong!\n";
		$self->echoer->ping();
	}

Then the Pinger would be created and run.

	Pinger->new()->run_all();

A complete, runnable version of this example is in the distribution as
eg/eg-37-ping-pong.pl.

=head2 Coderef Callbacks

Reflex supports any conceivable callback type, even the simple ones:
plain old coderefs.  In other words, you don't need to write objects
to handle events.

Here we'll start a periodic timer and handle its ticks with a simple
callback.  The program is still reactive.  Every second it prints
"timer ticked" in response Reflex::Interval's events.

	use Reflex::Interval;
	use ExampleHelpers qw(eg_say);
	use Reflex::Callbacks qw(cb_coderef);

	my $t = Reflex::Interval->new(
		interval    => 1,
		auto_repeat => 1,
		on_tick     => cb_coderef { eg_say("timer ticked") },
	);

	$t->run_all();

cb_coderef() is explicit placeholder syntax until a final syntax is
decided upon.

A complete, runnable version of the above example is available as
eg/eg-36-tiny-coderefs.pl in the distribution.

=head2 Promises Instead of Callbacks

Callback haters are not left out.  Reflex objects may also be used as
inline promises.  The following example is identical in function to
the previous coderef callback example, but it doesn't use callbacks at
all.

It may not be obvious, but the same emit() method drives all of
Reflex's forms of callback.  Reflex::Interval below is identical to
the Reflex::Interval used differently elsewhere.

	use Reflex::Interval;
	use ExampleHelpers qw(eg_say);

	my $t = Reflex::Interval->new(
		interval => 1,
		auto_repeat => 1,
	);

	while (my $event = $t->next()) {
		eg_say("next() returned an event (@$event)");
	}

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

Reflex itself contains some convenience methods for cleaner semantics.

=head2 run_all

Run all active Reflex objects until they destruct.

	# (omitted: create some Reflex objects)

	Reflex->run_all();
	exit;

=head1 BUNDLED MODULES AND DOCUMENTATION INDEX

Reflex bundles a number of helpful base classes to get things started.

=head2 Core Modules

The basic modules upon which most everything else is built.

=over 2

=item Reflex - Class library for flexible, reactive programs.

=item Reflex::Base - Base class for reactive (aka, event driven) objects.

=item Reflex::Role::Reactive - Make an object reactive (aka, event driven).

=back

=head2 Callback Adapters

Reflex provides adapters for nearly every kind of callback that
exists, including condvar-like promises that allow Reflex objects to
be used inline without callbacks at all.

=over 2

=item Reflex::Callback - Generic callback adapters to simplify calling back

=item Reflex::Callback::CodeRef - Callback adapter for plain code references

=item Reflex::Callback::Method - Callback adapter for class and object

=item Reflex::Callback::Promise - Non-callback, inline Promise adapter

=item Reflex::Callbacks - Convenience functions for creating and using

=back

=head2 POE Adapters

POE provides over 400 modules for various useful things.  Reflex can
work with them using these adapters.

=over 2

=item Reflex::POE::Event - Communicate with POE components expecting events.

=item Reflex::POE::Postback - Communicate with POE components expecting

=item Reflex::POE::Session - Observe events from a POE::Session object.

=item Reflex::POE::Wheel - Base class for POE::Wheel wrappers.

=item Reflex::POE::Wheel::Run - Represent POE::Wheel::Run as a Reflex class.

=back

=head2 Object Collections

It's often useful to manage collections of like-typed modules, such as
connections or jobs.

=over 2

=item Reflex::Role::Collectible - add manageability by Reflex::Collection

=item Reflex::Collection - Autmatically manage a collection of collectible

=back

=head2 I/O

Event driven programs most often react to I/O of some sort.  These
modules provide reactive I/O support.

=over 2

=item Reflex::Acceptor - non-blocking client socket acceptor

=item Reflex::Client - A non-blocking socket client.

=item Reflex::Connector - non-blocking client socket connector

=item Reflex::Role::Accepting - add connection accepting to a class

=item Reflex::Role::Connecting - add non-blocking client connecting to a class

=item Reflex::Role::Readable - add readable-watching behavior to a class

=item Reflex::Role::Recving - Mix standard send/recv code into a class.

=item Reflex::Role::Streaming - add streaming I/O behavior to a class

=item Reflex::Role::Writable - add writable-watching behavior to a class

=item Reflex::Stream - Buffered, translated I/O on non-blocking handles.

=item Reflex::UdpPeer - Base class for non-blocking UDP networking peers.

=back

=head2 Signals and Child Processes

Modules that provide signal support, including SIGCHLD for child
process management.

=over 2

=item Reflex::PID - Observe the exit of a subprocess by its SIGCHLD signal.

=item Reflex::Signal - Generic signal watcher and base class for specific

=back

=head2 Timers

Timer management has been relatively overlooked so far.  We'll get to
it eventually, and you're welcome to help.

=over 2

=item Reflex::Interval - An object that emits periodic events.

=back

=head2 Breadboarding Traits

Reflex also implements signal/slot style object interaction, through
emit() and watch() methods.  These traits were inspired by Smalltalk's
observable object attributes.

=over 2

=item Reflex::Trait::EmitsOnChange - Emit an event when an attributeâ€™s value

=item Reflex::Trait::Observed - Automatically watch Reflex objects.

=back

Reflex::Trait::EmitsOnchange exports a declarative emits() function
that simplifies use of this trait.  Likewise, Reflex::Trait::Observed
exports observes() to simplify its use.
