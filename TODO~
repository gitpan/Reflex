Current hot, outstanding TODOs:

---

Coderef callbacks require $self of the object calling them.
Otherwise, how do they invoke methods on that object?
I've done a half-baked implementation, but it needs:

	Testing.
	Examples and such modified.
	Document modifications.
	Release Reflex 0.080 since it's a big leap.
	Alert people that the world has changed slightly.

For a larger, longer-term list of todos, please see docs/TODO.otl.
