# This example illustrates explicit callbacks via classes, where
# callback events are mapped to class methods by name.  Methods may be
# named after the events they handle, or they may differ.

# Reflex::Callbacks and the Reflex::Callback helper classes will
# abstract callbacks to fulfill a number of goals.  The goals are
# detailed in docs/requirements.otl and summarized in
# eg/eg-20-rcb-callback.pl

# Create a thing that will invoke callbacks.  This syntax uses
# explicitly specified cb_class() callbacks and a scalar for the
# methods list.  cb_method() would be slightly more efficient in this
# case, but cb_class() also works.

# There is no nonambiguous implicit syntax at this time.  Suggestions
# for one are welcome.
