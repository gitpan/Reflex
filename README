       Reflex is a suite of classes to help programmers write reactive
       programs.  The project has some goals:

       +o Be concise.

       +o Be convenient.

       +o Be portable.

       +o Be fast.

       +o Don't get in the way.

       +o Release early, and release often.

       Sorry for the lack of documentation.  It conflicted with releasing
       early.  Contributions are very much welcome.  Give the project a reason
       to release often.

       TODO - Complete the documentation.

       See irc.perl.org #moose for help with Moose.

       See irc.perl.org #poe for help with POE and Reflex.

       Support is officially available from POE's mailing list as well.  Send
       a blank message to poe-subscribe@perl.org to join.

AACCKKNNOOWWLLEEDDGGEEMMEENNTTSS
       irc.perl.org channel #moose and #poe.  The former for assisting in
       learning their fine libraries, sometimes against everyone's better
       judgement.  The latter for putting up with lengthy and sometimes
       irrelevant design discussion for oh so long.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
       Moose, POE, the Reflex namespace on CPAN.

       TODO - Set up ohlo.

       TODO - Set up CIA.

       TODO - Set up home page.
